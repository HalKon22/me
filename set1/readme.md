**Done:**

**- [x] Graham, P. (2009). Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule.** *- Amazing article. It's so familiar to have two workdays each day, one on the manager's schedule and one on the maker's. "business stuff." =) How to manage this?! The question is still open. Unfortunately, we can only think about it but we can't do anything about it, unfortunately. However, removed work can probably make it easier for the maker's schedule.*
